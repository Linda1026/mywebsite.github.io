<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #666699;">5 Things You Didn't Know About Zootopia</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;">1.It is the&nbsp;longest cartoon story Disney has ever told</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">At 108 minutes, Zootopia is the second longest Disney animated film ever. Only its first collection of largely plotless, classical-music-themed shorts, Fantasia, is longer, at 126 minutes. That length is a sign of ambition: Zootopia seems to be more or less the right size for the breathless story it's telling and the rich world it's developing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;">2.Canadians will find one character eerily familiar</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Peter Mansbridge, Canada's rightly celebrated chief correspondent for CBC News and anchor of The National, gets to more or less play himself as Peter Moosebridge, a co-anchor of Zootopia's ZTV News. "I leapt at the chance" to cameo, Mansbridge said, "and the CBC did too. Why did I want to do it? Well, I didn't want to do it for me, I wanted to do it really for my kids and grandkids."</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #003366;">3. It's hairier than TangledCGI continues to take great leaps forward in Zootopia. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">One giraffe in this movie has 9 million CGI hairs on his body. That's more hairs than rendered in all the characters of the last three Disney animated features. Even Rapunzel's hair in Tangled was only made up of 100,000 to 200,000, but it still demanded the attention of 20 animators and 10 software engineers just to get it to behave. Admittedly, no one in Zootopia has fur quite as prominent as Rapunzel's hair was for most of the movie, but almost all the characters are covered in millions of tiny hairs and they all have to be convincing on their own terms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000080;">4. Nick Wilde looks a lot like Robin Hood</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Disney has played with talking animals since its first animated feature, and even in the days when Uncle Walt was putting out nothing but short cartoons. Some of those animals wore pants and walked like people and some of them didn't. Maybe you've heard of a mascot called Mickey and a deer named Bambi. But it didn't do a full-length animated film with animals in clothes until 1973's Robin Hood, which transformed the familiar characters of Sherwood Forest into foxes, bears, lions and such.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><br /></span><span style="color: #000080;">5. Alan Tudyk now has a four-weasel streak at Disney</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">The actor, who made Firefly fans laugh (and eventually weep) as Wash and has played Superman and Green Arrow in other cartoons, has been in the last four consecutive Disney Animation films, in far less sympathetic roles. In Wreck-It Ralph, he was the weaselly King Candy, who tricks his way into power. In Big Hero 6, he plays the weaselly Alistair Krei, whose willingness to cut corners and refusal to own up to the consequences earns him a vendetta from a revenge-crazed supervillain.<br /></span></p>
